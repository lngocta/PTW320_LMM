        <h1>Repayment Policy</h1>
        <p>In exchange for this educational assistance payment: </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the employee resigns from the Company or if the 
                    employee is terminated for cause (as determined by 
                    the Company, in its sole discretion), the employee 
                    must repay 100% of any tuition assistance received 
                    within the last 18 months. </li>
                <li>The employee must authorize, where legally permitted, 
                    the Company to offset against any monies, such as, 
                    but not limited to, wages, bonuses, commissions, 
                    stock incentive compensation or accrued unused 
                    vacation which are owed at the time of departure, to 
                    satisfy the employee’s assistance obligations. If a 
                    balance remains, the offset does not extinguish the 
                    remaining amount owed by the employee. 
                </li>
                <li>If the company terminates the employee for any reason 
                    other than cause, repayment of tuition assistance by 
                    the employee to the Company will be waived and the 
                    employee will be paid for all approved courses in 
                    which they are enrolled at the time of notification 
                    with approved payment request. The company will not 
                    reimburse any courses enrolled in after the 
                    notification of termination. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The employee understands and agrees to the commitments and 
            assistance obligations stated above. The employee authorizes, 
            to the extent allowed by law, the Company to offset against 
            any monies, such as, but not limited to, wages, bonuses, 
            commissions, stock incentive compensation or accrued unused 
            vacation which are owed at the time of departure to satisfy 
            the employee’s obligation to repay tuition assistance. If a 
            balance remains, the offset does not extinguish the remaining 
            amount owed by the employee or former employee.</p>
