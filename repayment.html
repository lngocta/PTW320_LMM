            <h2>Effective January 24, 2024</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Repayment should be requested within 30 calendar days 
                    following course completion.</li>
                <li>Employees will be repaid after providing proof of a 
                    pass grade of C or equivalent.</li>
                <li>Proof of course payment is required with supporting 
                    documentation.</li>
                <li>The employee must repay 100% of any tuition assistance 
                    received within the last 18 months if the employee 
                    resigns from the Company or if the employee is 
                    terminated for cause (as determined by the Company, 
                    in its sole discretion). </li>
                <li>LMM will waive repayment of tuition assistance for all 
                    applicable courses in which they are enrolled at the 
                    time of notification with approved payment request if 
                    the company terminates the employee for any reason other 
                    than cause.</li>
                <li>The company will not reimburse any courses enrolled in 
                    after the notification of termination. </li>
                <li>The employee must authorize, where legally permitted, 
                    the Company to offset against any monies, such as, but 
                    not limited to, wages, bonuses, commissions, stock 
                    incentive compensation or accrued unused vacation which 
                    are owed at the time of departure, to satisfy the 
                    employee’s assistance obligations. If a balance remains, 
                    the offset does not extinguish the remaining amount owed

            to the extent allowed by law, the Company to offset against 
            any monies, such as, but not limited to, wages, bonuses, 
            commissions, stock incentive compensation or accrued unused 
            acation which are owed at the time of departure to satisfy 
            the employee’s obligation to repay tuition assistance. If a 
            balance remains, the offset does not extinguish the remaining 
            amount owed by the employee or former employee.</p>
