        <h1>LMM Tuition Assistance Program</h1>
        <p>Continuous learning and development are values supported by LMM. 
            Our company offers a Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) as part 
            of ongoing investment in the growth and development of its 
            employees. The TAP provides financial assistance to employees 
            to acquire skills and knowledge that enhance performance in 
            their current role and/or prepare them for potential future 
            job responsibilities with LMM.</p>

        <p>The TAP covers appropriate costs for associate, undergraduate, 
            graduate, and post-graduate degrees, excluding Executive MBA 
            programs. The TAP also covers appropriate costs for certain 
            technical trade certifications specific to an employee's current 
            role or potential future roles with LMM.</p>

        <p>LMM’s tuition assistance program complies with the IRC Tuition Reimbursement program 
            outlined in Section 127. For more information on the IRC’s Education Assistance 
            Program, click <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/usc26/127" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
