            <ul>
                <li>Participants in the program are not eligible 
                    to receive payment for the same program or 
                    course more than one time. </li>
                <li>Failure to provide accurate information or 
                    not enroll in a course for which financial 
                    assistance has been requested will be 
                    considered a violation of the Company's Code 
                    of Conduct subject to disciplinary action up 
                    to and including termination.</li>
                <li>In the United States, any tuition assistance 
                    over $5,250 per year is considered taxable 
                    income. Any tax liability resulting from 
                    tuition assistance is the sole responsibility 
                    of the employee receiving the assistance. If 
                    outside of the U.S., check with local Human 
                    Resources or payroll. </li>
                <li>Payments for eligible expenses will be provided 
                    through standard payroll processes as soon as 
                    administratively possible upon submission of 
                    required documentation provided participation 
                    in the program has been fully approved.</li>
